      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Richard Dallaway notes about database unit testing inspired me the realization 
        of the DbUnit framework. I think this is a very good text about this subject. 
        Hopefully he gave me the permission to present excerpts from his notes 
        here on the DbUnit site.</p>
      <p>The original text is much longer and I strongly suggest you to read it 
        as well. See <a href="resources.html#RichardDallaway">resources</a> for 
        reference to it.<br>

      <h3>Unit testing database code</h3>
      <p>These are my notes on how I've gone about unit testing database functionality.</p>
      <p> [...]</p>
      <p>The problem is this: you have a SQL database, some stored procedures, 
        and a layer of code sitting between your application and the database. 
        How can you put tests in place to make sure your code really is reading 
        and writing the right data from the database? </p>
      <p> 
      <h3>Why bother?</h3>
      <p>I'm guessing some, if not a lot, of database development goes like this: 
        set up database, write code to access database, run code, do a SELECT 
        to see if the records showed up in the database. They did? Good, then 
        we're done. </p>
      <p>The problem with <strong>visual inspection</strong> is this: you don't 
        do it often, and you don't check everything every time. It's possible 
        that when you make changes to a system, maybe months later, you break 
        something and some data will go missing. As a coder you may not spend 
        much time checking the data itself, so it may take a while for this mistake 
        to surface. I've worked on a web project where a mandatory field on a 
        registration form was not being inserted into a database for the best 
        part of a year. Although marketing had protested that they needed this 
        information, the problem wasn't spotted because the data was never ever 
        looked at it (but don't get me started on that). </p>
      <p>Automated tests &#151; painless tests that run often and test lots &#151; 
        reduce the chances of your data is going missing. I find they make it 
        easier for me to sleep at night. (Tests have other positive features: 
        they're good examples of how to use code, they act as documentation, they 
        make other people's code less scary when you need to change it, they reduce 
        debugging time). 
      <p>[...] 
      <p>[B]ut how do we manage the testing data in the database so that it doesn't 
        &quot;mess up&quot; live data? &nbsp; 
      <p> 
      <p> 
      <h3>You need four databases</h3>
      <p>Some thoughts: A good test set is self-sufficient and creates all the 
        data it needs. Testing can be simplified if you can get the database in 
        a known state before a test is run. One ways to do this is to have a separate 
        unit test database, which is under the control of the test cases: the 
        test cases clean out the database before starting any tests.<br>
        <br>
        [...]<br>
        <br>
        Deleting and inserting data for every test may seem like a big time over 
        head, but as tests use relatively little data, I find this approach to 
        be quick enough (especially if you're running against a local test database).<br>
        <br>
        [...]<br>
        <br>
        The downside is that you need more than one database - but remember, they 
        can all run on one server if necessary. The way I'm testing now needs 
        four databases (well, two at a pinch): <br>
      <ol>
        <li>The <strong>production database</strong>. Live data. No testing on 
          this database. </li>
        <li>Your <strong>local development database</strong>, which is where most 
          of the testing is carried out. </li>
        <li>A <strong>populated development database</strong>, possibly shared 
          by all developers so you can run your application and see it work with 
          realistic amounts of data, rather than the hand full of records you 
          have in your test database. You may not strictly need this, but it's 
          reassuring to see your app work with lots of data (i.e., a copy of the 
          production database's data). </li>
        <li>A <strong>deployment databas</strong>e, or integration database, where 
          the tests are run prior to deployment to make sure any local database 
          changes have been applied. If you're working alone, you may be able 
          to live without this one, but you'll have to be sure any database structure 
          or stored procedure changes have been made to the production database 
          before you go live with your code. </li>
      </ol>
      With multiple database you have to make sure you keep the structure of the 
      databases in sync: if you change a table definition or a stored procedure 
      on your test machine, you'll have to remember to make those changes on the 
      live server. The deployment database should act as a reminder to make those 
      changes.&quot;<br>
