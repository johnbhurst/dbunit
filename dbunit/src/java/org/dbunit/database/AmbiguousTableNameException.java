import org.dbunit.dataset.DataSetException;

/**
 * This exception is thrown by {@link org.dbunit.dataset.IDataSet} when multiple tables
 * having the same name are accessible. This usually occurs when the database
 * connection have access to multiple schemas containing identical table names.
 * <p>
 * Possible solutions:
 * 1) Use a database connection credential that has access to only one database
 * schema.
 * 2) Specify a schema name to the {@link DatabaseConnection} or
 * {@link DatabaseDataSourceConnection} constructor.
 * 3) Enable the qualified table name support (see How-to documentation).
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Another common reason for this exception to be thrown is when an XML file
 * contains the same table multiple times whereas a different table is between
 * the definition of the duplicate table.
