      <question>
        Which database system are supported?
      </question>
      <answer>
    
      The Dbunit framework has been developed and tested with Oracle and HypersonicSQL. 
        It uses a fairly simple SQL syntax and should be compatible with the other 
        database systems. <a href="support.html">Let us know</a> if you find any 
        incompatibilities.

    <faq id="identity">
      <question>
        Can I use DbUnit with IDENTITY or auto-increment 
          columns?
      </question>
      <answer>
         <p>Auto-increment columns must be disabled in order to insert the dataset 
        values into the database. The way to disable this feature is database 
        specific. If your database does not provide a way to disable this feature 
        then you are out of luck and DbUnit cannot be used with it. </p>
      <p>Since version 1.4, DbUnit support IDENTITY columns for MS SQL Server 
        with the class <a href="components.html#IdentityInsertOperation">IdentityInsertOperation</a>.

      <question>
       Why I get a "Can't start a cloned connection" 
        exception when I use InsertIdentityOperation?
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>If you are using the Microsoft driver (i.e. <a class="code">com.microsoft.jdbc.sqlserver.SQLServerDriver</a>), 
        you'll need to use the <a class="code">SelectMethod=cursor</a> parameter 
        in the JDBC connection string (as outlined by <a href="http://forum.java.sun.com/thread.jsp?forum=48&amp;thread=184797">this 
        JDC thread</a>). Your database Url would look something like the following: 
      </p>
      <p> 
      <pre>jdbc:microsoft:sqlserver://localhost:1433;DatabaseName=mydb;SelectMethod=cursor

    <faq id="UnsatisfiedLinkError">
      <question>
      Why I get an "UnsatisfiedLinkError" 
        with the DB2 driver?
      </question>
      <answer>
       <p>DbUnit uses JDBC 2.0 features (batch updates). By default, DB2 installs 
        the JDBC 1.0 driver. You have to install the JDBC 2.0 driver in order 
        for DbUnit to work or you will get an <a class="code">UnsatisfiedLinkError</a> 
        from the DB2 JDBC 1.0 driver.</p>
      <p>The steps for installing the DB2 JDBC 2.0 driver are covered in the DB2 
        documentation.</p>

    <faq id="AmbiguousTableNameException">
      <question>
     Why I get a AmbiguousTableNameException?
      </question>
      <answer>
      <p>This situation occurs when no schema is specified and that DbUnit detect 
        that it is getting columns information from multiple tables having the 
        same name and located in different schemas.</p>
      <p>You can solve this problem in three different ways:<br></br>
        1. Provide the schema name when creating the database connection.<br></br>
        2. Ensure that the connection is restricted to access only one schema.<br></br>
        3. Use fully qualified table names as specified <a href="howto.html#multipleschema">here</a>.<br></br>

    <faq id="p6spy">
      <question>
     How to see SQL statements issued by DbUnit using P6Spy?
      </question>
      <answer>
     <p><cite>p6spy</cite> is a trasparent JDBC proxy-driver 
      specialized to log the statements performed against the actual driver you normally would use.
      Using p6spy would allow to log the SQL statements issued by DbUnit.
      See more at (<a href="http://www.p6spy.com">www.p6spy.com</a>). It could be useful to stick with version 1.1
      as 1.2 as some reported minor problems.</p>
      <p>To install P6Spy, complete the following steps:
      <ol>
        <li>Put the p6spy.jar file in your classpath.
        </li><li>Move spy.properties into a directory listed in your classpath.  Unlike
        JAR files, you do not directly reference your property file in the
        classpath (e.g.: if you have the file c:\r\proj\confspy.properties make sure you 
        put c:\r\proj\conf in the classpath).
        </li><li>Modify your application to use the P6Spy database driver i.e.
        com.p6spy.engine.spy.P6SpyDriver.
        </li><li>Modify the realdriver line in the spy.properties file to reflect the
        wrapped database driver. An example of a modified realdriver line follows:
    	realdriver = oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver
      </li></ol>
      Installation is complete. When you run your application, a spy.log file is
      generated in the same directory from where you run the application. 
      The log file contains a list of all of the database statements
      executed. You can change both the destination of spy.log and what it logs by
      editing the spy.properties file.</p>
