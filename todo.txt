Documentation:

* Convert existing website documentation to Jakarta-site2 XML format and generate HTML using Anakia. Maven and Cocoon are possible alternative. Actually the website is edited with Dreamweaver.

* Improve Javadoc. Many classes have no or very little javadoc documentation.

* Document DbUnit dependency (library + version + license).

---

Features:

* Alternate DTD export method using choice (OR) instead sequence (AND).

* Complete tests of FilteredDataSet filtering strategy (IncludeTableFilter & ExcludeTableFilter).

* Add wildcard capability to IncludeTableFilter strategy.

* Replace system properties with a DatabaseConfig class pushed to the DatabaseConnection. This is possible to replace all system properties with this class because they are all related to database connection. 

* DisableConstrainsOperation??? The way to disable/enable database constraints is vendor specific so this is impossible to implement on all RDMS platform. Big question, is the performance acceptable???  http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=4148317

* Determine the table sequence in DatabaseDataSet according exported/imported keys using information from DatabaseMetaData. Make it configurable because of performance cost. Make it a subclass of SequenceTableFilter???

---

Performance:

* Profile and improve DbUnit performance.

* Improve performance/memory usage of XML datasets implementation (using SAX???). 

---

Environment:

* Perform some cleanup in the DbUnit test suite (http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=3866272).
