The DbUnit database testing framework
http://www.dbunit.org/
---

DbUnit is a JUnit extension targeted for database-driven projects that, among 
other things, puts your database into a known state between test runs. This is 
an excellent way to avoid the myriad of problems that can occur when one test 
case corrupts the database and causes subsequent tests to fail or exacerbate 
the damage.

Main features:
* Ability to export and import your database (or specified tables) content to 
  and from XML datasets.
* Assert facility to verify that your database content match expected data 
  during your tests.
* Ant integration.
