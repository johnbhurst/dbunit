The dbUnit database testing framework
by Manuel Laflamme

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The dbUnit database testing framework is a JUnit extension which sets up your 
database in a known state before executing your tests. This framework uses xml 
datasets (collection of data tables) and performs database operations before 
and after each test. The dbUnit framework supports both the clean insert and 
the refresh strategies. 

Something worth noting: dbUnit is using itself in its own test suite!
